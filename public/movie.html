<h1> The Best Movies According to Isaac</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies of All Time </h2>
<hr/>
<h3>The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly</h3>
<p>Legendary Hollywood veteran, Clint Eastwood, does what he does best, kick ass, in this 1967 western classic</p>
<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>A classic revenge movie where all the people who deserve to die drop in their hundreds</p>
<h3>The Dark Knight Rises</h3>
<p>The second installmnet of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy where the joker gives the most memorable villain perfomance of all time. Is a must watch</p>
